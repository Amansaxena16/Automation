 Wrong thinking is the only problem in life Based on above part of bhavat gita create a real-life problem related to "Family Relationships Problems" on "Communication issues"
 

Solution:- 
In the context of Bhagavad Gita's teaching that wrong thinking is the root cause of all problems in life, we can relate it to family relationships and communication issues.

Real-life problem: Communication issues causing disruptions in family relationships

Situation: A family consisting of parents and two children is facing frequent misunderstandings and conflicts due to poor communication and wrong thinking.

The problem: The family members are struggling to express their thoughts and feelings effectively, leading to misunderstandings, resentment, and emotional distance. The lack of understanding and empathy amongst family members is causing strain in their relationships.

Solution based on Bhagavad Gita teachings:
1. Identify the root cause: Each family member should introspect and recognize their own wrong thinking patterns and assumptions that are affecting their communication with others.

2. Practice self-awareness and mindfulness: Encourage family members to cultivate self-awareness and mindfulness, as taught in the Bhagavad Gita, to recognize and control their thoughts and emotions before communicating with one another.

3. Cultivate empathy and understanding: Family members should make an effort to understand and empathize with each other's perspectives, acknowledging that everyone's viewpoint is valid and worthy of consideration.

4. Effective communication: Promote open and honest communication within the family, emphasizing active listening, clarity in expression, and the use of non-violent language to avoid misunderstandings.

5. Encourage forgiveness and reconciliation: Teach family members to let go of grudges and forgive past misunderstandings, as advocated in the Bhagavad Gita, to create an atmosphere of love and harmony within the family.

By integrating the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and addressing the root cause of wrong thinking and miscommunication, the family can work towards resolving their communication issues and strengthening their relationships.
